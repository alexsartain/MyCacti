<h2>Mammillaria:</h2>
<p><b>Light:</b> Mammillaria species appreciate strong light, but many species dislike more than four hours of direct summer sunlight. Provide bright, even light for the best results.<br><br>
<b>Water:</b> Allow the soil mix to become nearly dry between waterings, but then water thoroughly. Immaculate drainage is essential, so never let the pots sit in water. Suspend watering in the winter, but mist occasionally.<br><br>
<b>Soil:</b> A rich, fast-draining cactus mix is ideal.
Fertilizer: During the growing season, fertilize with a cacti fertilizer mix. Suspend feeding during the dormant winter period.</p>

<h2>Euphorbia Enopla:</h2>
<p><b>Light:</b> Euphorbia need lots of sunlight, especially in the Summer.<br><br>
<b>Water:</b> Euphorbias often die from too much care and watering than from neglect. They also do not handle long periods of drought well, and may require weekly watering in the summer. Water deeply when the soil becomes dry, but avoid letting the cactus sit in the water. <br><br>
<b>Soil:</b> They do not require a specific soil pH but add some organic matter or fertilizer, meanwhile if they are being grown in a container or in poor soil feed with a half-strength fertilizer monthly.</p>

<h2>Echinocactus grusonii:</h2>
<p><b>Light:</b> Nickname the Golden Barrel cactus, or humorously "Mother-in-Laws cushion", the Echinocactus grusonii requires regular sunlight so place close to a window.<br><br>
<b>Water:</b> Like most cacti it doesn't like being exposed prolonged periods of water, so water generously but not too often. Avoid high humidity as this can also lead to rot. <br><br>
<b>Soil:</b> No specific soil pH is mentioned, but to improve growing use fertiliser and cactus soil. They are vulnerable to many pets so try and identify infestation as early as possible before treating with the "leave toxic option."</p>

<h2>Cephalocereus senilis (Old Man Hairy Cactus):</h2>
<p><b>Light:</b> This funny looking, and hairy cactus, requires hot dry climates with frequent bright sunlight. They can be grown outdoors and as tall as 45 feet but generally grow slowly when potted.<br><br>
<b>Water:</b> Water when the first few inches of soil are completely dry. During winter water around 1-2 times only.<br><br>
<b>Soil:</b> No specific soil pH is mentioned, but to improve growing use fertiliser and cactus soil, the soil should be kept dry.</p>

<h2>Austrocylindropuntia Subulata:</h2>
<p><b>Light:</b> This long-named cactus requires a lot of Sun and light from being left outside or potted indoors.<br><br>
<b>Water:</b> It should not be watered often, and watered only when the soil is fully dry to avoid rot.<br><br>
<b>Soil:</b> No specific soil pH is mentioned, but to improve growing use fertiliser and cactus soil, the soil should be kept dry. If the cactus gets a fungus infection, it should be repotted after treatment. Once repotted, avoid watering for a while.</p>

<h2>Opuntia ficus-indica (Prickly Pear):</h2>
<p><b>Light:</b> Like most desert cacti, the "Prickly Pear" requires a lot of sun and heat, so place close to a light source. It shares the same genus as the "Austrocylindropuntia Subulata" but due to their large variety the cacti may have to be cared for slightly differently.<br><br>
<b>Water:</b> It should not be watered often, and watered only when the soil is fully dry to avoid rot.<br><br>
<b>Soil:</b> No specific soil pH is mentioned, but to improve growing use fertiliser and cactus soil, the soil should be kept dry. If the cactus gets a fungus infection, it should be repotted after treatment. Once repotted, avoid watering for a while.</p>
